# Spark
Spark is an application intended to increase the productivity of workers, especially those working at home. It includes many tools such as messaging between team members, a customizable todo list, a calendar to see what your goals are, a public project dashboard, and more. We believe this product can help many employees stay productive and succeed during the quarantine due to COVID-19.
